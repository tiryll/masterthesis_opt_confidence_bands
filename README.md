i) General Information
----------------------

This repository contains the files to replicate the results presented in my masterthesis:***Optimal Simultaneous Confidence Bands for Impulse Response Functions of SVAR-Models***.

The folder *src* contains the source code, while the folder *bld* contains the raw data for the application considered in the thesis. By running the code, *bld* will be expanded 
by intermediate and final results.

The code has been entirely written in MATLAB and requires at least MATLAB 2023a and the parallel computing toolbox.

---------------------
ii) Source Code & Data Overview 
---------------------

The structure of the *src* folder is as follows:

- *application*
- *MATLAB*
- *simulation*

The folder *application* contains a MATLAB-live script that creates Figure 2, discussed in section 5. The folder *MATLAB* contains all functions used in the scripts
